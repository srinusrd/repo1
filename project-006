 Decomposing your project means identifying deliverables and breaking each deliverable down into its component tasks. You will keep doing this until you get to the smallest work tasks possible.


project scope --> project plan

Project scope is a definition of the end result or mission of your projectâ€”a product or service for your client/customer.



The scope should be developed under the direction of the project manager and
customer. The project manager is responsible for seeing that there is agreement
with the owner on project objectives, deliverables at each stage of the project,
technical requirements, and so forth. For example, a deliverable in the early stage
might be specifications; for the second stage, three prototypes for production; for
the third, a sufficient quantity to introduce to market; and finally, marketing promotion
and training.

Your project scope definition is a document that will be published and used by
the project owner and project participants for planning and measuring project
success. Scope describes what you expect to deliver to your customer when the
project is complete. Your project scope should define the results to be achieved in
specific, tangible, and measurable terms.




To review, each work package in the WBS
1. Defines work (what).
2. Identifies time to complete a work package (how long).
3. Identifies a time-phased budget to complete a work package (cost).
4. Identifies resources needed to complete a work package (how much).
5. Identifies a single person responsible for units of work (who).
6. Identifies monitoring points for measuring progress (how well).
