
    Level 0 - I can identify what the actual problem is and what's causing it.
    Level 1 - I can find/ identify an existing solution (created by someone else) and am able to apply it.
    Level 2 - I can take a pre-made solution and tweak it to better suit this particular problem.
    Level 3 - I can create my own solutions and don't need the help of others.
    Level 4 - I can evaluate a solution and identify how good/ robust/ elegant it is.


1) Sets objectives. The manager sets goals for the group, and decides what work needs to be done to meet those goals.

2) Organizes. The manager divides the work into manageable activities, and selects people to accomplish the tasks that need to be done.

3) Motivates and communicates. The manager creates a team out of his people, through decisions on pay, placement, promotion, and through his communications with the team. Drucker also referred to this as the “integrating” function of the manager.

4) Measures. The manager establishes appropriate targets and yardsticks, and analyzes, appraises and interprets performance.

5) Develops people. With the rise of the knowledge worker, this task has taken on added importance. In a knowledge economy, people are the company’s most important asset, and it is up to the manager to develop that asset.


 Functions of Managers
Managers just don't go out and haphazardly perform their responsibilities. Good managers discover how to master five basic functions: planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling.

    Planning: This step involves mapping out exactly how to achieve a particular goal. Say, for example, that the organization's goal is to improve company sales. The manager first needs to decide which steps are necessary to accomplish that goal. These steps may include increasing advertising, inventory, and sales staff. These necessary steps are developed into a plan. When the plan is in place, the manager can follow it to accomplish the goal of improving company sales.

    Organizing: After a plan is in place, a manager needs to organize her team and materials according to her plan. Assigning work and granting authority are two important elements of organizing.

    Staffing: After a manager discerns his area's needs, he may decide to beef up his staffing by recruiting, selecting, training, and developing employees. A manager in a large organization often works with the company's human resources department to accomplish this goal.

    Leading: A manager needs to do more than just plan, organize, and staff her team to achieve a goal. She must also lead. Leading involves motivating, communicating, guiding, and encouraging. It requires the manager to coach, assist, and problem solve with employees.

    Controlling: After the other elements are in place, a manager's job is not finished. He needs to continuously check results against goals and take any corrective actions necessary to make sure that his area's plans remain on track.




    What is important to the success of this process?
    For each of the items that are important, why are they important?
    For each reason they are important, what is the risk of failure?
    For each of the risks items, how can they be minimized or eliminated?
    For each way the risk items can be minimized or eliminated, which are under your control?
    For each one under your control, what can you to to implement the risk mitigation process?

The Look-For's
Milestone 1 (No Way) Look-For's

At this stage you haven't gotten started. You may or may not be doing ok, you don't know because nothing is documented, automated or measured.

    Results are inconsistent.
    Different people execute processes differently.
    Processes aren't documented.
    The team can't enumerate all the processes a team does (even at a high level).
    IT department responsible for "everything with an electric plug" and, therefore, unable to do anything.
    Requests get lost or stalled indefinitely
    Unable to predict how long common tasks take to complete.
    Little or no measurement or metrics.
    No dashboards.
    You think customers are happy but they aren't.
    Operational problems, if reported, don't get attention.
    It is common (and rewarded) to enact optimizations that benefit a person or small group to the detriment of the larger organization or system.
    Departmental goals emphasize departmental performance at the detriment of organizational performance. 

Milestone 2 (Way 1a) Look-For's
The end-to-end process is documented and repeatable by more than one person. There are few ad hoc steps (if any exist, they are identified). The system produces relatively consistent results.

    End-to-end process has each step enumerated, with dependencies.
    End-to-end process has each step's process documented.
    Different people doing the tasks the same way.
    Sadly, there is some duplication of effort seen in the flow.
    Sadly, some information needed by multiple tasks may be re-created by each step that needs it. 

Milestone 3 (Way 1b) Look-For's
The First Way has been achieved. The flow is one direction: left to right (i.e. work doesn't need to go back to be re-done or fixed). Defects are not passed down the line. Process changes are no longer process surprises. We may not be achieving our objectives but at least they are defined. For example we now know we want to have all new service requests done in 48 hours but we may or may not be measuring completion time to know whether or not we are hitting that objective.

    Each step has QA checklist before handing off to next step.
    There is a process by which all learn of changes to others' processes (Ex: Ops attends Dev standups; Dev attends Ops meetings.)
    Information needed by multiple steps is created once.
    No (or minimal) duplication of effort.
    Ability to turn-up capacity of flow repeatably.
    ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: THE FIRST WAY 

Milestone 4 (Way 2) Look-For's
The Second Way has been achieved. Feedback flows upstream so that the process can be improved and surprises are reduced. Problems are amplified rather than hidden. For each step we measure wait time, task duration, number of defects, and any rework.

    There are feedback mechanisms for all steps.
    Oncall pain shared by the people most able to fix problems.
    Dashboards exist showing each step's completion time; lag time of each step.
    Dashboards exist showing current bottleneck, backlog, idle steps.
    Dashboards show defect and rework counts.
    Periodic (weekly?) review of defects and reworks.
    Postmortems published for all to see, draft within X hours, final within X days.
    Periodic review of alerts by affected team. Periodic review of alerts by cross-functional team.
    Process change requests require data to measure problem being fixed.
    Dashboards report data in business terms (i.e. not just technical terms).
    Every "fail-over procedure" has a "date of last use" dashboard.
    Capacity needs predicted ahead of need.
    ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: THE SECOND WAY 

Milestone 5 (Way 3) Look-For's
The Third Way has been achieved. There is a culture of experimentation and learning. The team spends more time on innovation than fighting fires. Operations are driven by science, not folklore or guesswork.

    After process changes are made, before/after data compared to determine success.
    Process changes are reverted if before/after data shows no improvement.
    Process changes that have been acted on come from a variety of sources.
    At least one process change has come from every step (in recent history).
    Cycle time enjoys month-over-month improvements.
    Mechanisms exist so that any fail-over procedure not utilized in recent history is activated artificially.
    Stress-testing and failover testing done periodicly (quarterly or monthly).
    "Game Day" exercises (intensive, system-wide tests) done periodicly (at least yearly).
    The team employees a statistician.
    Decisions supported by modeling "what if" scenarios using extracted actuals data
    ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: THE THIRD WAY

==========================================================================================================================

Careful planning
Not trying to be too clever
Contingency plans in case of issues


1: You need the ability to learn and adapt because the real world is nothing like school. New tech is always coming out and you need to be able to adapt.

2: You need to know how to program/script. Because working smarter and not harder is the only way to stay ahead of all the work.

3: People skills again. "Plays well with others" is always a good thing.

4: Backup. Have a disaster recovery plan and test it 2-4 times per year. Recover a file from your backups at least once per month if not once per week.

5: Never do more than 1 change at a time if feasible. It makes it hard to troubleshoot.
