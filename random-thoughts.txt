Just as both the gentlest and most violent waves in an ocean are equally water, likewise both attractive
forms and repulsive forms are equally manifestations of emptiness. Realizing this, our mind will become
balanced and peaceful. We will recognize all conventional appearances as the magical play of the mind,
and we will not grasp strongly at their apparent differences.

A magician creates various things
Such as horses, elephants and so forth.
His creations do not actually exist;
You should know all things in the same way.

The last two lines of this verse mean that just as we know that the horses and elephants created by the
magician do not exist, in the same way we should know that all the things that we normally see do notactually  exist.

Develop a mind that is vast like space, where experiences both pleasant and unpleasant can appear and disappear without conflict, struggle or harm. Rest in a mind like vast sky.

The Guest House

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy,a depression,a meanness,
Some momentary awareness comes 
As an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if theyâ€›re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,

still,treat each guest honourably,
He may be clearing you out for some new delight.

The dark thought,the shame,the malice,
meet them at thedoor laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.
