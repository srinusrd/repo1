• Speed of Deployment – Initially, a new server was set up with a multi-week 
iterative process that took the box from Jumpstart to being fully 
functional. Each application was added as needed, and could take 
over a month. Olsen said, “Now, it takes 20 minutes with Jumpstart 
and just 20 minutes more until the box is ready. It is trivial and 
repeatable; no iteration is needed to configure a machine.” 

• Ease of Use and Professional Services – Though Olsen was able to learn 
Puppet fairly easily from the wiki and similar community resources, 
his team still found professional services to be a useful 
investment. Puppet Labs’ professional services team assisted with 
finding and simplifying repetitive code, while enterprise support 
fostered a deeper understanding of the software. 

• Password Synchronization – For security reasons, the passwords for each 
server expire after 90 days. Under the old system, the expiration 
dates were spread out, and admins wasted time regaining access and 
re-setting passwords. Puppet allowed Heartland to synchronize its 
passwords and simplify and streamline the necessary security 
precautions. Olsen confirms, “We save 90 minutes on each event.” 

• Environment Feature – Puppet’s environment feature was particularly
useful in determining how well the infrastructure would work with 
different aspects of the platform, allowing the sysadmins to test 
out changes before committing to them. 

• PCI Compliance – Because the company holds and uses personal data in many of its loyalty 
campaigns, it is required to adhere to the Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)—the international security standard 
for the payment card industry. With a run of Puppet, PCI 
requirements are done
