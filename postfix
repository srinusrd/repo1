3- Tell Postfix to process the queue now

postqueue -f

OR

postfix flush

This will cause Postfix to immediately attempt to send all queued messages.

4- Delete queued mail

Delete all queued mail

postsuper -d ALL

Delete only the differed mail queue messages (i.e. only the ones the system intends to retry later)

postsuper -d ALL deferred
