Just as both the gentlest and most violent waves in an ocean are equally water, likewise both attractive
forms and repulsive forms are equally manifestations of emptiness. Realizing this, our mind will become
balanced and peaceful. We will recognize all conventional appearances as the magical play of the mind,
and we will not grasp strongly at their apparent differences.

A magician creates various things
Such as horses, elephants and so forth.
His creations do not actually exist;
You should know all things in the same way.

The last two lines of this verse mean that just as we know that the horses and elephants created by the
magician do not exist, in the same way we should know that all the things that we normally see do notactually  exist.
