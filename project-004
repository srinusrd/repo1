For example, Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel all have over
1,000 projects being implemented concurrently every day of the year across borders
and differing cultures. Questions: How do these organizations oversee the
management of all these projects? How were these projects selected? How do they
ensure performance measurement and accountability? How can project management
continually improve? Centralization entails integration of all project processes and
practices to improve project management.
Integration is designed to improve project management in the whole organization
over the long haul. The rationale for integration of project management was
to provide senior management with:


• An overview of all project management activities;
• A big picture of how organizational resources are being used;
• An assessment of the risk their portfolio of projects represents;
• A rough metric for measuring the improvement of managing projects relative
to others in the industry;
• Linkages of senior management with actual project execution management.
